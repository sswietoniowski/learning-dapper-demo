# Dapper Demo

Small example showing use of Dapper instead of ADO.NET, "database first" approach and layered architecture. This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create a new MSSQL database name "DapperDemo" on a localhost (or change connection string),
- create database schema by opening "Database" project and using "Publish".
