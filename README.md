# Dapper Demo

Small example showing use of [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) instead of ADO.NET, "database first" approach and layered (n-tier) architecture. This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create a new MSSQL database named "DapperDemo" on a localhost (or change the connection string),
- create database schema by opening the "Database" project and using "Publish" from the context menu.

Genereal overview of the layered (n-tier) architecture can be found [here](https://medium.com/@hidayatarg/n-tier-layer-architecture-in-c-15b8fe97283c).
